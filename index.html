<! Hello.

I made this website for school work over the Coronavirus break. You can see the Files and images at https://github.com/GrandpaBenjamin/StrawsForTurtles. I drew both the turtles and the plastic straw beach. I also edited the image of the child throwing the straws into the ocean.

:)

	<p>Turtles live inside the water but they do not breathe water therefore they must inhale the O₂. This is why we must give them snorkels.</p>

			<p><font size="4">Upon birth a turtle makes its way towards the ocean only to have a 1% survival rate. Do you know why? Its because when they enter the water they cant breathe and many drown. This astonishing figure can be changed. By waiting for the eggs to hatch and putting straws inside their noses they are more likely to survive. This new appendage lets the turtles access the O₂ without running the risk of getting snatched out of the water by a bird.</font></p>
